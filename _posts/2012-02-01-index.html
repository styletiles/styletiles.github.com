        <h2>Who</h2>

        Style tiles are for people who design
        websites and website design systems.

        <h2>What</h2>
    </header>
    <h4>What is a Style Tile?</h4>
    <p>
        A design deliverable consisting of fonts, colors and interface
        elements that communicates the evolution of a visual brand for the web.
    </p>
    <h4>What Are They Good For?</h4>
    <p>
        Style tiles help to form a common visual language between the designers
        and the stakeholders and provide a catalyst for discussions around the
        preferences and goals of the client.
    </p>
    <h4>How to Explain Style Tiles to Clients, Friends &amp; Other Interested Parties</h4>
    <p>
        A style tile is a tray of interface design snippets that define words that
        the stakeholders agree represent their brand. It is similar to the paint chips
        and fabric swatches an interior designer gets approval on when designing a room.

        <h2>When</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
        Style tiles are for when a moodboard is too vague and a comp is too literal.
        Style tiles establish a direct connection with actual interface elements
        without defining layout. They work well for clients who have established
        brands and need them to translate smoothly to the web.

    <p>
        An integrated process makes style tiles work. These are the steps that I have
        found to be most efficient when using style tiles in my web design process.

                    Real text needs to be added here, this was redundant.

            <h4>Design Kickoff Meeting</h4>
            <p>
                Designers should be in every meeting. Be prepared.
                Have the stakeholders complete a survey before the meeting
                or have everyone answer questions together.
            </p>
            <h4>Questions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Goal-oriented</li>
                <li>Exploratory</li>

                <h3>Interpret Through Visuals</h3>
                <p>
                    Aggregate adjectives from the answer process, identify
                    themes and sort similarities.
                </p>
            </header>
            <h4>Break down Client Feedback</h4>
            <p>
                Humans make subconscious assumptions based on subtle visual cues.
                The elements of design are the building blocks and the principles
                are how you use them. Interpret how the adjectives you received can
                represent these building blocks at the most basic level.
            </p>

                    <li>Color</li>

                <h3>Determine the Visual Language</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the actual process of composing the style tile.
                    Determine themes from the aggregated adjectives and begin to
                    match them up with styles. This gives the client a point of
                    reference to determine if you both are on the same page.

                <li><img src="" alt="" /></li>

                <h3>Iteration</h3>
                <p>
                    Making Changes in style out of the context of layout
                    takes less time and allows you to work faster.

            <h4>Human Nature</h4>
            <p>
                It's human nature to combine options; fostering a process
                that allows for an evolution of stylistic elements without
                compromising the design goals makes iteration a great
                option for getting to the final goal faster.
            </p>

                <img src="" alt="" /> + <img src="" alt="" /> = <img src="" alt="" />
