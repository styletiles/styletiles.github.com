            <h4>Open source your design process</h4>
            <p>
                Style Tiles work for me. Designers all have different challenges.
                I am sharing my process to contribute back a solution to a problem
                that I have encountered. Open Source is all about sharing what works
                for us and building upon that to help progress our industry. Share what
                works best for you, and help elevate the quality and standards of our
                chosen professions.
            </p>
            <p>
